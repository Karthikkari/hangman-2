The provided code is a simple Hangman game implemented in C.
It randomly selects a word from a predefined list, displays it with underscores representing unguessed letters, and allows the player to guess one letter at a time.
It tracks the guessed letters and updates the display accordingly, while also displaying a visual representation of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts, with appropriate messages displayed in either case.
